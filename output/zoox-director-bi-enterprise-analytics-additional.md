# Additional Information

**For:** Zoox - Director of Business Intelligence & Enterprise Analytics

---

My foundation is in biotech, where regulatory stakes demand rigorous data practices. This rigor translates directly to enterprise BI: at CareDx, I built forecasting capability from scratch that reduced error from 6% to 0.9%, drove 10% revenue increase through predictive modeling and causal inference, and oversaw a Tableau portfolio of 20+ dashboards spanning Sales, Manufacturing, Operations, and Production. I also led enterprise AI transformation to 92% Copilot adoption across 750 employees and deployed LLM applications—including a RAG-based knowledge platform and a TPP-scoring agent that informed our 5-year product roadmap. This work touched every business function: Finance, Commercial, Operations, Supply Chain, Product, Billing, IT, and R&D. I'm drawn to Zoox because building world-class BI and analytics capability for an organization at the intersection of robotics, ML, and operations is exactly the kind of enterprise-wide transformation I've been driving.
