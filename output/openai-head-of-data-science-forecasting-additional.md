# Additional Information

**For:** OpenAI - Head of Data Science and Machine Learning, Global Forecasting

---

My foundation is in biotech, where validation failures cost millions and regulatory stakes demand getting the ML and causal inference right the first time. This rigor translates directly: at CareDx, I applied the same discipline to enterprise forecasting—reducing error from 6% to 0.9%—and to commercial analytics that drove 10% revenue growth. In the past year alone, I've built a forecasting capability from scratch, deployed a churn prediction system covering $270M in revenue, and led AI transformation to 92% adoption across 750 employees. I'm drawn to OpenAI because forecasting in a usage-based, hypergrowth environment is exactly the kind of high-stakes, high-ambiguity problem where this background pays off.
